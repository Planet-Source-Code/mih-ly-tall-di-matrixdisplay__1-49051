You can create charsets(bitmap fonts) with this tool.
First you need to specify the width and height of the
characters in your new charset. 
Then you can click 'Create a new charset' for an empty
charset, or create one from a BMP file. You can see an
example for a bitmap to use for this function in the main
directory of CharMaker("Charset 8x12 ASCII.bmp" and
"Charset 8x15 ANSI.bmp", to name it).

On the next screen you will see the Charset editor.
You edit one character at a time, presented in a 15x
magnification on the left(You can see the current character
in normal size below the big edit area.).

The current character can be selected by the scrollbar below
the edit area, or by clicking in QuickJump.
By default, QuickJump shows an overview of your characters
in normal size.
You can change this to a standard ASCII or ANSI charcter table using
the button below the QuickJump picture, so you can easily choose
a specific character, even if you haven't painted that character yet.

Editing a character is easy: in the edit area, use the left mouse
button to paint a pixel in the character, and use the right button
to erase one.

You can determine if a character is underlineable by checking or
unchecking the 'This character underlineable' checkbox. (Usually
spaces are not underlineable.)
You can set the underlineable flag for every character by pressing
the 'Underline all' button on the bottom.

The underline height can also be set here.

If you're ready, save your work. From now, you can use your new
charset with MatrixDisplay.
